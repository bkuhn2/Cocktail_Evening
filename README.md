# Cocktail Evening

### [Deployed Project](https://cocktailevening.netlify.app/)

## Abstract

Cocktail Evening is a React application that helps users plan parties by searching and choosing which cocktails they'll want to serve. Designed for a user that appreciates a streamlined UI/UX and making cocktails, potential users can search for cocktails either by their name or by the ingredients in them (i.e., a "vesper", or cocktails that have "gin" or "bitters"). Clicking on an individual cocktail in the search results will show more detailed info and can then add it to the offering for their event. Users can also navigate to their event page to see their offering, with the ability to remove cocktails from this as well.

This app uses the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) and uses Cypress testing to ensure bug free functionality.

## Context

This app was created as a student project for the Turing School of Software and Design and written in a one-week sprint.

## Project Goals and Objectives
- Solidify and demonstrate our understanding of React, Router, asynchronous JavaScript, Cypress testing.
- Create an app and have a workflow focused around user stories and user personas to cater to a target audience.
- Display and manipulate data from an API.
- Responsive CSS - multiple styles depending on screen size.

## Wins and Challenges
- One of the biggest challenges was time, but was pleased that I was able to accomplish what I was able to given the short timeframe, though there are still extensions I want to add.
- Efficient use of controlled forms and inputs.
- Expanded knowledge and use of React hooks and new React Router version 6 functionality.
- Expanded knowledge and more efficiently employing Cypress test suite.
- Use of logic and iterators to process and display 3rd party data.
- Responsive - works and is visually congruent across web/mobile viewing.


## Future Extensions
- Local or back end storage
- Letting the user create and add to multiple events
- Making a share-able 'menu' for parties or invitations or shopping lists
